## Project Title:

What number am I thinking of? (Between 1-10)




## Project Description:

 The app has three levels of difficulty. It generates a random number based on the difficulty level and gives the user unlimited attempts to guess that number. If the user guesses the number correctly, a new number will be generated. There is a scoreboard displaying the high score of total numbers the user guesses correctly in a row. After failing to guess one consecutive number, the score will again start from zero. The user can end the game at any time and after ending the game the app displays the highest score.





## Functional Requirements:

•	There is a begin button on the first page.

•	After clicking the begin button the user must select the level of difficulty.

•	Easy difficulty generates random numbers from 1-10.

•	Medium difficulty generates random numbers from 1-50.

•	Hard difficulty generates random numbers from 1-100.

•	The user is taken to the game screen after selecting level of difficulty.

•	The computer continues to generate random numbers until the user guesses one correctly.

•	Points start counting on how many consecutive numbers the user guesses correctly.

•	After the streak breaks, the user is prompted to enter their name.

•	The highest score is stored.

•	The user can end the game anytime.

•	Ending the game leads to a leaderboard of all the highest scores.
